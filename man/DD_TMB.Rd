\arguments{
\item{x}{An index for the objects in \code{Data} when running in closed loop simulation.
Otherwise, equals to 1 when running an assessment.}

\item{Data}{An object of class \linkS4class{Data}.}

\item{condition}{A string to indicate whether to condition the model on catch or effort (ratio of catch and index).}

\item{AddInd}{A vector of integers or character strings indicating the indices to be used in the model. Integers assign the index to
the corresponding index in Data@AddInd, "B" (or 0) represents total biomass in Data@Ind, "VB" represents vulnerable biomass in
Data@VInd, and "SSB" represents spawning stock biomass in Data@SpInd.}

\item{SR}{Stock-recruit function (either \code{"BH"} for Beverton-Holt or \code{"Ricker"}).}

\item{rescale}{A multiplicative factor that rescales the catch in the assessment model, which
can improve convergence. By default, \code{"mean1"} scales the catch so that time series mean is 1, otherwise a numeric.
Output is re-converted back to original units.}

\item{MW}{Logical, whether to fit to mean weight. In closed-loop simulation, mean weight will be grabbed from \code{Data@Misc[[x]]$MW},
otherwise calculated from \code{Data@CAL}.}

\item{start}{Optional list of starting values. Entries can be expressions that are evaluated in the function. See details.}

\item{prior}{A named list (R0, h, M, and q) to provide the mean and standard deviations of prior distributions for those parameters. R0, index q, and M priors are
lognormal (provide the mean in normal space, SD in lognormal space). Beverton-Holt steepness uses a beta prior, while Ricker steepness uses a normal prior.
For index q, provide a matrix for nsurvey rows and 2 columns (for mean and SD), with NA in rows corresponding to indices without priors.
For all others, provide a length-2 vector for the mean and SD.
See vignette for full description.}

\item{fix_h}{Logical, whether to fix steepness to value in \code{Data@steep} in the assessment model.
Automatically false if a prior is used.}

\item{dep}{The initial depletion in the first year of the model. A tight prior is placed on the model objective function
to estimate the equilibrium exploitation rate that corresponds to the initial depletion. Due to this tight prior, this F
should not be considered to be an independent model parameter.}

\item{LWT}{A named list of likelihood weights. For \code{LWT$Index}, a vector of likelihood weights for each survey, while
for \code{LWT$MW} a numeric.}

\item{silent}{Logical, passed to \code{\link[TMB]{MakeADFun}}, whether TMB
will print trace information during optimization. Used for diagnostics for model convergence.}

\item{opt_hess}{Logical, whether the hessian function will be passed to \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}} during optimization
(this generally reduces the number of iterations to convergence, but is memory and time intensive and does not guarantee an increase
in convergence rate). Ignored if \code{integrate = TRUE}.}

\item{n_restart}{The number of restarts (calls to \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}) in the optimization procedure, so long as the model
hasn't converged. The optimization continues from the parameters from the previous (re)start.}

\item{control}{A named list of parameters regarding optimization to be passed to
\code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used).}

\item{fix_sd}{Logical, whether the standard deviation of the data in the likelihood (index for conditioning on catch or
catch for conditioning on effort). If \code{TRUE}, the SD is fixed to value provided in \code{start} (if provided), otherwise,
 value based on either \code{Data@CV_Cat} or \code{Data@CV_Ind}.}

\item{fix_tau}{Logical, the standard deviation of the recruitment deviations is fixed. If \code{TRUE},
tau is fixed to value provided in \code{start} (if provided), otherwise, equal to 1.}

\item{integrate}{Logical, whether the likelihood of the model integrates over the likelihood
of the recruitment deviations (thus, treating it as a random effects/state-space variable).
Otherwise, recruitment deviations are penalized parameters.}

\item{inner.control}{A named list of arguments for optimization of the random effects, which
is passed on to \code{\link[TMB]{newton}} via \code{\link[TMB]{MakeADFun}}.}

\item{n_itF}{Integer, the number of iterations to solve F within an annual time step when conditioning on catch.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\linkS4class{Assessment}} containing objects and output from TMB.

\description{
A simple delay-difference assessment model using a
time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB. The model
can be conditioned on either (1) effort and estimates predicted catch or (2) catch and estimates a predicted index.
In the state-space version \code{DD_SS}, recruitment deviations from the stock-recruit relationship are estimated.
}
\details{
For \code{start} (optional), a named list of starting values of estimates can be provided for:
\itemize{
\item \code{R0} Unfished recruitment. Otherwise, Data@OM$R0[x] is used in closed-loop, and 400\% of mean catch otherwise.
\item \code{h} Steepness. Otherwise, Data@steep[x] is used, or 0.9 if empty.
\item \code{M} Natural mortality. Otherwise, Data@Mort[x] is used.
\item \code{k} Age of knife-edge maturity. By default, the age of 50\% maturity calculated from the slots in the Data object.
\item \code{Rho} Delay-difference rho parameter. Otherwise, calculated from biological parameters in the Data object.
\item \code{Alpha} Delay-difference alpha parameter. Otherwise, calculated from biological parameters in the Data object.
\item \code{q_effort} Scalar coefficient when conditioning on effort (to scale to F). Otherwise, 1 is the default.
\item \code{F_equilibrium} Equilibrium exploitation rate leading into first year of the model (to determine initial depletion). By default, 0.
\item \code{omega} Lognormal SD of the catch (observation error) when conditioning on effort. By default, Data@CV_Cat[x].
\item \code{tau} Lognormal SD of the recruitment deviations (process error) for \code{DD_SS}. By default, Data@sigmaR[x].
\item \code{sigma} Lognormal SD of the index (observation error) when conditioning on catch. By default, Data@CV_Ind[x]. Not
used if multiple indices are used.
\item \code{sigma_W} Lognormal SD of the mean weight (observation error). By default, 0.1.
}

Multiple indices are supported in the model. Data@Ind, Data@VInd, and Data@SpInd are all assumed to be biomass-based.
For Data@AddInd, Data@I_units are used to identify a biomass vs. abundance-based index.

Similar to many other assessment
models, the model depends on assumptions such as stationary productivity and
proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance.
Unsurprisingly the extent to which these assumptions are
violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method.
